Computer Architecture

Hw1: Implementation of binary search tree in both C and Python. Observing 'performance differences' between these two different languages.

Hw2: Implementation of some binary search tree operations in MIPS assembly language.

Hw3: Implementing instructions in Verilog with MIPS-lite single-cycle datapath and revised control units.

Hw4: In this assignment, I've run a set of experiments and analysed the results in order to understand the cache behavior of programs, how different cache designs affect program execution.
